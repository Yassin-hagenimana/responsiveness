    This will scale the main to a max-width of 40rem, meaning it will max out
    The last trick I use on any page that requires a single column of content in the
    center (which is basically every basic website made this year). I usually put this
    on my main, as that’s where my main
    content will reside (duh):on 40rem but it will still automatically shrink to
    smaller sizes. Obviously, you’re free to change this value to suit your website’s
    needs. The margin: 0 auto makes sure the content gets centred horizontally.
